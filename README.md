The project aims to create a set-up that will:
-> monitor the air quality levels in the environment of a patient to warn
them regarding the risk and suggest they carry their inhaler.
-> set reminders for the patient to take the inhaler dosage on time.

Functions performed by product:
->A module (python) will be used to receive data from the sensors.
->Another module will process the data received from sensors and classify
the environmental conditions as harmful or normal.
-> A THINK SPEAK  application will be the interface where the patient can view the
data related to inhaler usage and environmental conditions.
->A database will keep track of air quality
